# Data Science in Transportation

This repository contains a collection of Data Science projects focused on various aspects of the transportation industry. Each project is organized in a separate folder and includes Jupyter Notebooks that demonstrate the analysis, modeling, and visualization of transportation data. The datasets used in these projects are also provided within their respective folders.

## Folder Structure

- **Project 1: Traffic Accident Analysis**
  - **Jupyter Notebook:** Analyzes traffic accident data to identify key trends, risk factors, and predictive models for accident occurrence.
  - **Dataset:** Contains data related to traffic accidents, including location, time, weather conditions, and severity of accidents.

- **Project 2: Public Transit Demand Forecasting**
  - **Jupyter Notebook:** Focuses on forecasting public transit demand using historical data and machine learning models to improve service planning and resource allocation.
  - **Dataset:** Includes historical ridership data, weather conditions, and other relevant factors influencing public transit usage.

Each project is self-contained, with all necessary data and code provided, making it easy to follow and replicate the analyses.
